  summary: A blazing fast library to work with the conda ecosystem

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    Rattler is a library that provides common functionality used within the conda
    ecosystem. The goal of the library is to enable programs and other libraries to
    easily interact with the conda ecosystem without being dependent on Python. Its
    primary use case is as a library that you can use to provide conda related
    workflows in your own tools.
